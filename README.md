# Personal Portfolio

### Description

Personal Portfolio is a project developed for a front-end class to showcase programming skills. Inspired by a tutorial from ByteGrad ([YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUKptmUVIBM)), this project has been an invaluable learning experience. I've learned the latest features of Next.js 13, including Next.js App Router, Server Actions, Client & Server Components, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Context API, Advanced Animations with Framer Motion, React.Email & Resend, Custom React Hooks, Fresh Modern UI Design, Light & Dark mode, and a Responsive website.\
Throughout this journey, I've encountered challenges, and gained skills and knowledge that will continue to propel me forward in my programming career.
